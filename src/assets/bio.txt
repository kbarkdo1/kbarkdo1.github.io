I love building things and breaking things, and then building them again, less breakably. 
I'm a graduate of Swarthmore College with a Bachelors in Mathematics and Computer Science. 
I spent a lot of time using computers to do math, and using math to talk about computers. 
Now I apply that same reasoning to making the weird, the wonderful, the complicated, and the simple. 
I love all human beings, so please reach out to me in any way, at any time.
